## Portfolio of a Full-Stack Developer

Hi there! I'm a Full-Stack Developer on my way to becoming a seasoned professional. I have experience in developing web applications using a variety of programming languages, frameworks, and databases.

## Technology Stack

The following are the technologies I have used in my projects:

Programming languages: Java, TypeScript, Golang
Frameworks: SpringBoot, React, Next.Js
Databases: PostgreSQL, Redis
Message Queue: Kafka
Containerization technology: Docker
Skills and Experience
I have experience in building full-stack web applications, from the front-end to the back-end. I have a deep understanding of web technologies, such as HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and how to use these to build responsive and user-friendly applications.

I have hands-on experience in using Java, TypeScript to build scalable and performant back-end systems. I have a good understanding of object-oriented programming and have worked on developing RESTful APIs, microservices, and message-driven systems.

My experience with frameworks such as SpringBoot, React, and Next.Js has given me the ability to build highly scalable and robust applications. I have a good understanding of how to use these frameworks to build web applications with a focus on performance, scalability, and security.

I have worked with databases such as PostgreSQL and Redis and have experience in designing and implementing data storage solutions. I have a good understanding of SQL and NoSQL databases and have worked on developing data-driven applications.

I have experience in using Kafka as a message queue to handle asynchronous communication between microservices. I have a good understanding of how to use message queues to build scalable and robust systems.

I have experience in using Docker to containerize applications and deploy them to various environments. I have a good understanding of how to use Docker to build, test, and deploy applications in a consistent and repeatable way.

## Projects

I have worked on several projects that showcase my skills and experience as a Full-Stack Developer. Some of these projects include:

Note Me: A web application that allows users to create and manage their own to-do lists. The back-end was built using Java and SpringBoot, while the front-end was built using React. The application was deployed using Docker.

Hire Me: A microservice-based system that allows users to store and retrieve their personal data. The microservices were built using Golang and deployed using Docker. The front-end was built using Next.Js and was connected to the microservices using RESTful APIs.

## Conclusion

I am a Full-Stack Developer with experience in building web applications using a variety of technologies. I have a deep understanding of web technologies, programming languages, and databases, and have worked on developing scalable and performant systems. I am always looking to improve my skills and take on new challenges, and I am confident that I can contribute to any project I work on.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
